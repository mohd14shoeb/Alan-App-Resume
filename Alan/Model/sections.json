		"content" : "I'm an iOS Software Engineer from Sydney, Australia. I've been writing software for iOS for over five years for large businesses in Australia, as well as startups and personal projects. As a freelancer, I have been involved in dozens of iOS apps on the App Store — either as a developer or consultant. In industry, I have worked for MDM solution providers, mobility providers and currently for Yahoo Inc. I have written software for the enterprise; creating iPad–based retail installations deployed at retailers as far as New York! \n \n I love design. My affinity for design was born after studying Human Computer Interaction. I design a lot of my software — this app was entirely designed from scratch! \n \n I have completed a Bachelor of Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts at UNSW. \n \n I have been employed by UNSW as a Casual Academic, teaching Human Computer Interaction, Introductory Computer Science and Introductory Computing for Engineers. \n \n I teach iOS Development at UNSW for free classes, and I have taught iOS Development in industry for General Assembly in Sydney. \n \n I have picked a small handful of apps to showcase in this app — the great majority of my work in freelance is protected from disclosure. \n \n You may need to set your device's locale to Australia to see some of the apps in SKStoreProductViewController."
